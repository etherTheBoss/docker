### What is Docker?
Docker is a platform or ecosystem around creating and running <strong>containers</strong>.

##### Docker Ecosystem:
 - Docker <strong>Client</strong>
 - Docker <strong>Server</strong>
 - Docker <strong>Machine</strong>
 - Docker <strong>Images</strong>
 - Docker <strong>Hub</strong>
 - Docker <strong>Compose</strong>

### What is Container?
A container is an instance of an <strong>image</strong>. It is kind of
 running a program with its own isolated set of hardware resources. However, it kind of has its own little 
 set or its own little space of memory has its own little space of networking technology and its own little 
 space of hard drive space as well.

### What is Image?
An image is a single file containing all the dependencies and all the 
configurations required to run a very specific program. This single file that stored in our hard drive and 
at some point in time, we can use the image to create something called a <strong>container</strong>.

### What is Client?
Docker client is also known as <strong> Docker CLI</strong>. It does not actually do anything with containers or images. 
Instead, the docker client is really just a tool or a portal of sorts to help us interact with another 
piece of software that is included in the docker for Windows or Mac packages called the <strong>Docker Server</strong>. 
Docker client interacts with the <strong>Docker server</strong>.

### What is Server?
This is also frequently called the docker daemon. This program is an actual tool or the actual piece of 
software that is responsible for creating docker containers, images maintaining containers uploading images, 
and doing just about everything it can be possibly imagined around the world of docker.
